			<p>
				RallyCats was founded in the summer of 1977 by UC students Alvin Roehr and Randy Smith. 
				The RallyCats quickly grew to be the largest student group on campus. 
				We are a group deeply focused on having fun through participation in (mainly athletic) 
				events that promote spirit in and at the University of Cincinnati. 
				In almost a decade, we have steadily increased our presence on campus with innovative 
				programming that celebrates UC, feverish support at Bearcat sporting events, and 
				helping to develop leaders who make a difference both in RallyCats and across campus.
